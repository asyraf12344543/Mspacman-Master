Ms. Pac-Man: Maastricht
=============

This is the repository for the "maastricht" Ms. Pac-Man agent.
 
The agent won the CIG'12 edition of the Ms. Pac-Man vs Ghost Team competition: http://www.pacman-vs-ghosts.net/competitions/4

Moreover, the agent obtained a 2nd place at the WCCI'12 edition of the competition: http://www.pacman-vs-ghosts.net/competitions/3

If you would like to know more about the agent check out the paper describing the methods used: http://geneura.ugr.es/cig2012/papers/paper106.pdf

If you would like to improve or extend the agent please send me an e-mail at tom.pepels (at) maastrichtuniversity (dot) nl

1) Download the Ms Pac-Man Java-based framework from the following URL.
 http://gameaibook.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mspacman-master.zip
 You should use Java IDE such as Eclipse to import the project into your workspace.  Once properly configured, run the main class “Executor.java”.  Each member of the group should perform this step and ensure that  all members are able to run the project successfully.  Write a brief report (not more than 100 words) to discuss the experience of the group in setting up Ms Pac-Man framework.  The report must be uploaded into  Putrablast.


2) Use at least TWO AI methods discussed in the lecture to implement TWO different Ms Pac-Man agents.  
 Hints:  You may use available Java templates/classes/packages to implement the agent.  BUT you must cite/make reference of the source.

3? Design a performance measure and compare the performance of the TWO algorithms (through the TWO agents).
